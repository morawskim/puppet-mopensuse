# VirtualHost template
# Note: to use the template, rename it to /etc/apache2/vhost.d/yourvhost.conf. 
# Files must have the .conf suffix to be loaded.
#
# See /usr/share/doc/packages/apache2/README.QUICKSTART for further hints 
# about virtual hosts.
#
# NameVirtualHost statements can be added to /etc/apache2/listen.conf.
#
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for requests without a known
# server name.

    # documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
    # symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.

    #   A request for / will need to be mapped to a resource on the fcgi
    #   backend. Failure to address this may cause a blank response, commonly
    #   known as a WSOD (White Screen of Death), especially if only a request URI
    #   containing the php extension is proxied, such as this example. The
    #   processing chain will first map a request for / to /index.php or any other
    #   index.php file relative to the current request uri, then proxy to the PHP-
    #   FPM backend correctly.
    DirectoryIndex /index.php index.php

    # Optionally, include *.conf files from /etc/apache2/conf.d/
    #
    # For example, to allow execution of PHP scripts:
    #
    # Include /etc/apache2/conf.d/php5.conf
    #
    # or, to include all configuration snippets added by packages:
    # Include /etc/apache2/conf.d/*.conf
