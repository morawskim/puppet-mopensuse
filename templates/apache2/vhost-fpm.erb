# VirtualHost template
# Note: to use the template, rename it to /etc/apache2/vhost.d/yourvhost.conf.
# Files must have the .conf suffix to be loaded.
#
# See /usr/share/doc/packages/apache2/README.QUICKSTART for further hints
# about virtual hosts.
#
# NameVirtualHost statements can be added to /etc/apache2/listen.conf.
#
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for requests without a known
# server name.

  # A request for / will need to be mapped to a resource on the fcgi
  # backend. Failure to address this may cause a blank response, commonly
  # known as a WSOD (White Screen of Death), especially if only a request URI
  # containing the php extension is proxied, such as this example. The
  # processing chain will first map a request for / to /index.php or any other
  # index.php file relative to the current request uri, then proxy to the PHP-
  # FPM backend correctly.
  DirectoryIndex /index.php index.php

  # Optionally, include *.conf files from /etc/apache2/conf.d/
  #
  # For example, to allow execution of PHP scripts:
  #
  # Include /etc/apache2/conf.d/php5.conf
  #
  # or, to include all configuration snippets added by packages:
  # Include /etc/apache2/conf.d/*.conf

  #
  # This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.
